Astral Stack, is a free personal application dashboard under the name of Astral, minimal and easy to use. <br>
Some features are not yet working, due to laziness. [Learn More](link) <br>
If you have knowledge of c# + wpf, you can edit source of Astral and create a pull request. <br>
Astral stack uses wpf for its UI and c# for its backend.

## How to build?
To edit the application, first re-build the project, for any reason, then the intellisense should load. The views can be found under MVVM-Views<.
- Clone the repo `gh repo clone yurkyu/AstralStack`
- Open AstralStack.sln in Visual Studio 2022.
- Set Release x64
- Ctrl + Shift + B (build)
